Development 1 Progress Report 

Code for MIDI enable, MIDI FX, and updating the slider parameters was pulled from class, chatgpt, and the internet 

Have not yet integrated the chain fx, right now the midi signal can only go through in one direction and you cannot reorder the chain 

Having trouble getting it all to work: not expierancing any errors and my code is conceptionally sound from what we learned in class but I'm probably missing something small or approaching it in the wrong direction.
